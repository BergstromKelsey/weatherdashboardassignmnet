Weather Dashboard Assignment

This project provides the user with weather data on any city they input. Recent inputs will be saved in the users local storage and displayed on the page. Upon submitting a city, user will be able to see current local weather, aspects including temperature, humidity, UV index and windspeed. User will also be able to see the forecast for the next 5 days in that area.

This project was a lot more challening than I expected. I struggled with appending information from the local storage on to the html page. It was really cool to learn how to use API's, it is a lot easier than I thought! 

To use this site, just simply enter a city of your choice!
